# Introduction to Cyber Security

## Intro to Offensive Security
- Process of breaking into computer systems and exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them

## Intro to Defensive Security
- process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing any potential digital threats.
- investigate infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cyber-criminals or monitoring infrastructure for malicious activity
- Concerned with two main tasks
    - Preventing intrusions from occurring
    - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

Tasks related to defensive security include
- User cyber security awareness
- documenting and managing assets
- Updating and patching systems
- Setting up preventative security devices
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices


### Security Operations Center (SOC)
Team of security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.

Some of the main areas of interest of SOC are:
- Vulnerabilities
- Policy Violations
- Unauthorized activity
- Network intrusions


### Digital Forensics
Areas of interest
- File System
- System Memory
- System Logs
- Network Logs

### Incident Response
Major phases of incident response process:
- Preparation
- Detection
- Containment, Eradication and Recovery
- Post Incident Activity

### Malware Analysis
Malware includes many types such as:
- Virus
- Trojan Horse
- Ransomware

Malware Analysis aims to learn about such malicious programs using various means
- Static analysis works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. Usually, this requires solid knowledge of assembly language
- Dynamic analysis works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities. It lets you observe how the malware behaves when running

# Introduction of Offensive Security

## Web Application Security
- Web applications is like a "program" that we can use without installation as long as we have a modern standard web browser such as Firefox, Brave, Safari, Chrome etc.

Many companies offer bug bounty programs, A bug bounty program allows the company to offer a reward for anyone who discovers a security vulnerability in the companies systems

### Web Application Security Risks

#### Identification and Authentication Failure
- Identification refers to the ability to identify a user uniquely. 
- Authentication refers to the ability to prove that the user is whom they claim to be.

#### Broken Access Control
- Access control ensures that each user can only access files related to their role/work
- Always give permissions by applying _principle of least privilege_ rile

#### Injection
Refers to a vulnerability in the web application where the user can insert malicious code as part of their input. One cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user's input

#### Cryptographic Failures
Refers to failures related to cryptography. It focuses on the process of encryption and decryption of data.

# Introduction to Defensive Security

## Intro to Digital Forensics
After getting the proper legal authorization, the basic plan goes as follows:
- Acquire the evidence
- establish a chain of custody
- Place the evidence in a secure container
- Transport the evidence to your digital forensics lab
    - Retrieve the digital evidence from the secure container
    - Create a forensic copy of the evidence
    - Return the digital evidence to the secure container
    - Start processing the copy on your forensics workstation
