## Introduction to Defense Security

Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:

1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

1. User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against various attacks that target their systems.
2. Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the types of systems and devices that we have to manage and protect properly.
3. Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
4. Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
5. Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Without proper logging and monitoring of the network, it wonâ€™t be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to know.

SOC - monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.

Some of the main areas of interest of a SOC are
1. Vulnerabilities
2. Policy Violations
3. Unauthorized activity
4. Network intrusions


Four major phases of the incident response process are:
1. Preparation:
    - This requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents. Ideally, various measures are put in place to prevent incidents from happening in the first place.
2. Detection and Analysis
    - Team has the necessary resources to detect any incident, moreover it is essential to further analyze and detected incident to learn about its severity
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
    - Once an incident is detected, it is crucial to stop it from affecting other systems. eliminate it and recover the affected systems.
4. Post-Incident Activity
    - After successful recovery, a report is produced and the learned lesson is shared to prevent similar future incidents


Malware Analysis
- Software refers to program, documents, and files that you can save on a disk or send over the network, Malware includes many types, such as
    - Virus
    - Trojan Horse
    - Ransomware

Malware analysis aims to learn about such malicious programs using various means:
1. Static Analysis works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. Usually this requires solid knowledge of assembly language(processor's instruction set)
2. Dynamic analysis works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities. It lets you observe how the malware behaves when running.

SIEM gathers security related information and events from various sources and presents them via one system
